        review: "This is easily the most beautiful RPG book I've seen. Luckily it's not just a pretty face. The rule system is light and fast, but with lots of options. If you are interested in action Horror RPG's this book is must have.",

        title: "5e: HARDCORE MODE",
        review: "I am a massive fan of this Publisher/Author, and I was excited to see how they would make 5E hardcore. Unfortunately, I don't think many of the ideas in this book would make the game better without significant changes. That being said, it is very affordable and may be worth checking out if game design and house rules are your jam.",

        title: "Neon City Overdrive",
        review: "This rule system is perfect for Cyberpunk themed one-shots or short campaigns. The rules system is super neat and light, and I prefer it to the POA system. If you are a GM this is one of those rule systems that will make you better by getting you to think about games and characters in new ways.",

        title: "7th Sea (2nd Edition)",
        review: "The rules are a mess. It's almost like the rules are trying to offer the choices of a complex game while maintaining the speed of rules-light systems. Unfortunately, it doesn't deliver on either. The setting is SO AMAZING, though. If you are looking for an alternate Europe setting for your next game, this is it.",
